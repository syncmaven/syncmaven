title: What is Syncmaven?
---


*Syncmaven* is an open-source framework for synchronizing data from database to external services. It also called Reverse-ETL or Data Activation. If you familiar with [DBT](getdbt.com),
think of Syncmaven as DBT equivalent for saving modelling results to external services.

## Use Cases

- **Ads**: Syncmaven can be used to sync your customers from your database to advertising platforms like Facebook, Google, and Twitter.
By exporting list of your customer's email (or "audience") to these platforms, so you can retarget your existing customers or create lookalike audiences.
- **Email Marketing**: Syncmaven can be used to sync your customers from your database to email marketing platforms like Mailchimp, Sendgrid, or Klaviyo.
- **CRM**: Syncmaven can be used to sync your customers from your database to CRM platforms like Salesforce, Hubspot, or Intercom.

## Progress

Syncmaven is in active development. Although it's used in production already, the list of sources and destinations is limited.
We are working on adding more sources and destinations. You can check the progress [here](#progress).
