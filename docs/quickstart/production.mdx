Since Syncmaven has a command-line interface, there are plenty of ways to run it in production starting from a
simple Cron to a more sophisticated tools such as Dagster or Airflow.

However, since typically Syncmaven project is kept in a
git repository, the fastest way to setup scheduled sync is to use Github Actions.

# Scheduled sync with Github Actions

Here is an example of a Github Actions workflow that runs Syncmaven every day at 3am, and
also on every push to the `main` branch.

```yaml
name: Sync Run

on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 3 * * *'
  branches:
    - main
env:
  DATABASE_URL: ${{ secrets.DATABASE_URL }}
  MIXPANEL_PROJECT_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.MIXPANEL_PROJECT_TOKEN }}

jobs:
  sync:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: syncmaven/github-action@v1
```

All environment variables that are defined in the `env` section will be passed to the [Syncmaven project](/fundametals/project). They
can be used as `${env.VAR_NAME}` in any of the Syncmaven configuration files.
