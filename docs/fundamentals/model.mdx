Model tells Syncmaven how to access the data in the database. Typically, it's represented by a SQL query
along with parameters. The query is executed by Syncmaven to fetch the data from the database.

Models are defined in the `./models` directory of the project.

# SQL file

Model can be defined in a SQL file. The file should have a `.sql` extension. The file should contain a SQL query

```sql
--{{ config "name" "Active Users" }}
--{{ config "datasource", env.POSTGRES_URL }}

SELECT * FROM users WHERE active = true;
```

In addition to the SQL query, the file can set model configuration using the `config` directive

```
-- {{ config "param" "value" }}
```

Please note that the `config` directive should be in a comment block to be ignored by the SQL parser.

The model must define `datasource`, which is the connection string to the database. Also, the model have two optional
parameters `name` and `id`. Default values for these parameters is the file name without the extension.

# YAML file

Model can also be defined in a YAML file. The file should have a `.yaml` or `.ymk` extension:

```
name: Active Users minus Paid Users
datasource: ${env.POSTGRES_URL}
query: SELECT * FROM users WHERE active = true AND paid = false;
```

As in the SQL file, the YAML file must define `datasource` and `query`. `name` and `id` are optional parameters.

# Datasource

## Postgres

To connect to a Postgres database, the `datasource` should be a connection string: `postgres://user:password@host:port/dbname`
