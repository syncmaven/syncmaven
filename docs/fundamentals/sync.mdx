Sync is a process that synchronizes the data between the [model](/fundamentals/model) and the [destination](/fundamentals/destination).

Sync consists of reference to a [connection](/fundamentals/connection), reference to [model](/fundamentals/model) that is being synchronized
and an optional enrichment configuration. It's defined in a `syncs` folder in the project directory in a `.yaml` or `.yml` file.

```yaml
model: all-users
destination: facebook
options:
  ...
  ...
enrichments:
  ...
  ...
```

`model` references the [model](/fundamentals/model) by id. The id of the model equals the name of the model file without the `.yaml` extension, unless
the parameter `id` is explicitly set in the model file.

`destination` references the [connection](/fundamentals/connection) by id. The id of the connection equals the name of the connection file without the `.yaml` extension,
the parameter `id` is explicitly set in the destination file.

`options` set the configuration for connection. They are specific to [connection](/fundamentals/connection)
