In order to implement [Incremental Sync](/fundametal/incremental-sync), Syncmaven need
to persist state between sync runs. State also can be used by connectors internally to
cache some data for optimization purposes.

<Note>
  State is always optional, and syncs can work without it. You can run every sync in a full refresh mode,
  which means state will be ignored. Also, you can not provide state at all.

  The internal structure of state can be found on [Protocol](/fundamentals/protocol) page.
</Note>

Syncmaven provides a several ways to store state

# Local files

By default, Syncmaven stores state in bunch of local files in `<project-dir>/.state` directory. This is convenient
for local debugging.
