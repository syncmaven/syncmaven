<Tip>To generate an empty project run `syncmaven init`</Tip>

Syncmaven Project is represented by a folder that contains all the necessary files to define how your data should be synced. The project folder contains the following sub-folders:

| Folder | Description |
| ----   | ----------- |
| `models` | Defines [Model](/fundamentals/model). Each model contains an SQL query and metadata |
| `connections` | Defines [Connections](/fundamentals/connection). Each connection tells Syncmaven on how to connect to a certain service. Connections are used in *syncs*, see below|
| `syncs` | Defines [Syncs](/fundamentals/sync). Each syncs define how data should be synced from a source to a destination|


Each model, sync or connection is defined in a separate `.yml` or `.yaml` file (models can be defined with `.sql` files as well). Every file can reference environment variables using the `${env.VAR_NAME}` syntax.

The project can contain `.env` and `.env.local` files. If any of these files exist, Syncmaven will load the environment variables from them (`.env.local` will override `.env`).

## Environment Variables

Environment variables can be used in the project files. In fact, they **must** be used for sensitive information like passwords or API keys.
In addition to variables passed to a process, Syncmaven will from

 - `.env` file in the project root
 - `.env.local` file in the project root
 - `.env` file in the current working directory
 - `.env.local` file in the current working directory
 - Variables from file specified by `--env-file` command line argument. It's possible to specify multiple files
by using the `--env-file` argument multiple times.

Variables from those files will be merged with last file having the highest priority.
