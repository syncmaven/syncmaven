The "Connection" defines how Syncmaven should connect to an external service, which typically involves a set of credentials required for this connection.



Connections are defined in the connections folder of a [Syncmaven project](/fundametals/project). Each connection is defined in a `.yml` or `.yaml` file and can reference environment variables through the `${env.VARNAME`} syntax:

```yaml
kind: facebook
credentials:
  accessToken: ${env.FACEBOOK_ADS_ACCESS_TOKEN}
  accountId: ${env.FACEBOOK_ADS_ACCOUNT_ID}
```

Each file must specify two nodes: `kind`, which defines the connection type, and `credentials`, which contains the credentials.

<Info> It is important not to store credentials in the connection file for security reasons. Refer to them through `${env.VARIABLE}` instead</Info>

The connection does not specify how the connected service should be used; it merely defines how Syncmaven should establish the connection. Connections are user in [syncs](/fundamentals/syncs)
to connect to destinations or enrichments.

# Manifests

A connection can have one or several manifests, depending on how the connections may be used.
If a connection can be used as a destination, it has a destination manifest. For more information about the manifest structure, please refer the [Protocol](/fundametals/protocol) section.

In order to access a manifest of connection, execute `syncmaven manifest` to display all available connections and their manifest types. Then, run `syncmaven manifest -t <manifest-kind> -p <destination or enrichment>`.
