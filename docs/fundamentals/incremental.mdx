Syncmaven supports incremental syncs. This means that subsequent syncs will only fetch the data
that has changed since the last sync. Plus, it supports checkpointing via same mechanism. If
long-running sync fails in the middle, the next run will carry on from where it left off.

# Cursors

The main mechanism for incremental syncs is cursors. A cursor is a field in [model](/docs/models) that
only grows over time. For example, `updated_at` field in a table is a good candidate for cursor, or
`id` if it is auto-incrementing.

Cursors are defined in [model](/fundamentals/models)

```sql
--{{ config("name", "Users" ) }}
--{{ config("datasource", "${env.DATABASE_URL}") }}
--{{ config("cursor", "updated_at") }}

select * from users where :cursor is null or updated_at >= :cursor
```

In the model configuration above, cursor is defined as `updated_at`. The model will only fetch rows where `update_at`
value is greater than the last `cursor` value, which is stored in the [sync state](/fundamentals/state) and
referenced by `:cursor` in the query.

<Info>
  For the first runs, and full refreshes, the cursor value will be `null`. It means that all rows will be fetched.
  So the query should be able to handle `null` cursor value properly, note the `:cursor is null` part in the query.
</Info>

## Checkpointing

The same mechanism is used for checkpointing. Sync will save a cursor value periodically, after a batch of 100
rows by default. If the sync fails in the middle, the next run will start from the last saved cursor value.
